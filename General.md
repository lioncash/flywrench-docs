# General

This section lays out general techniques that don't correspond to a particular planet.


## Use level boundaries to your advantage

When you spawn into a level, your ship falls quite slowly. This can waste milliseconds if the goal is beneath the spawn point. We can use the bounce mechanic the game gives us to save time, however.

Consider Pluto's first level:

![Pluto - Level 1]({{ site.url }}/images/Level1.png)

In this case it would be faster to super-flutter upwards twice and then bounce off the top of the diamond's point, rather than just let the ship fall downwards.
